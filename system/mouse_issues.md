My mouse is messed up?

This sometimes happens after I've moved the usb plugs around and the last thing I ever think of being the cause of my issues.

For wireless mice plugging into USB3.0 input can cause interference.  Almost every time I've had issues, moving the dongle to a usb2.0 plug resolves the issue.
