I've  been using JIRA for the past 5 years and Asana for a couple months now.  While both products are very compelling, their philosophy is different.
Asana is more focused on **immediate efficiency**.  It's very efficient at managing the now. Keyboard shortcuts make it a  breathe to create / update issues. You can use it to quickly jot down  tasks during a meeting.

In JIRA, it takes longer to create  issues. On the whole, the product "feels" heavier and slower. Creating  and updating issues takes more time than in Asana. However it provides  powerful **reporting tools** (graph of issues created vs closed over a  period, activity stream...). I have seen JIRA instances with 10,000+  issues - I'm not sure what this would look like in Asana.
Using  JIRA, people in my team often need to create a separate document (such  as a Google 

Spreadsheet or a wiki page) to list the 10-15 issues that  need to be done **now**. Asana is very well suited for this use case, where its real-time nature shines.

The customization capabilities of both tools are also very different. **If you're currently heavily relying on custom data models in JIRA, you might find it difficult to replicate them in Asana.**  The company has stated its aim to let users build custom data models  for tasks in the future, but this has not been implemented yet.
In  terms of vision, whereas JIRA is mostly focused on the software  development use case, Asana bills itself as a tool that will change the  way people work within an organization. While Asana software does not  fully execute on this vision yet, there are hints that it could become  the piece of collaboration glue that brings together people, actions and  assets within an organization, giving everyone a real time vision of  what is going on **right now**.
What it really comes down to is simple : **what's your use case?**  How many people are you working with? On what type of project? How many  tasks do you think you will store in there? Are you already using one  of these tools?
Based on your answers to these questions, the  right answer for you could be JIRA, Asana, both at the same time - or  even none of them :-)

**Benefits of JIRA**JIRA  is a powerhouse. The tool is built to scale, and as soon as you’re set  up you’ll see a tremendous boost to your team’s output. Technical users  love JIRA for its details and rich feature set. Their marketplace also  allows for some great add-ons.That being  said, I wouldn’t ask my non-technical teams to learn JIRA. There are  much easier platforms out there which are easily learned and optimal for  the everyday user. Asana fills this role.**Benefits of Asana**Asana  offers a visually appealing interface with vibrant colors and  animations. The solution is extremely intuitive which allows ease of use  - no matter the skill level. Due to it’s instinctive nature, creating  tasks within Asana is instant as you don’t have to sift through  unnecessary features to get started. Unfortunately, this lack of  advanced features could be the downside to using Asana as well as not  having any sort of hierarchy structure to improve organization within  the tool. This makes things tough for larger, technical teams.

**How to Only Use One Tool **

HOWEVER,  adding more software to your team’s list is NOT what you want. This is  why I have to recommend staying away from using either of these tools  when you have teams in different industries working together. There are  platforms such as [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/)  that allow salesmen to speak with software engineers with ease. Keeping  everyone in the same tool allows for easy cross-team collaboration.  This is accomplished with customized workspaces that still share the  same core features. ClickUp allows you to enable the advanced features  of a tool like[ JIRA](https://clickup.com/jira-alternative) for specific technical workspaces while keeping things as simple as [Asana](https://clickup.com/asana-alternative) for the rest.Have a look at my [comparison chart](https://taskreports.com/comparison-chart/) for more details on all three tools!
