SassDoc parses your source folder to grab documentation-specific comments. From there, it builds a data tree, that gets enhanced and filtered before being passed to the view. So you end up with a fully styled HTML document, like this:

Introduction[§](#introduction)
------------------------------

SassDoc comes with surprisingly few configuration in itself. Most of the configuration is [brought by the theme](/customising-the-view/). However, you don’t have to set up a configuration file in the theme package, that would be silly.

Here is how it works: SassDoc merge the configuration file you provide (or that is being automatically fetched) with the one from the theme. If an option is set in both files, the one you set yourself overrides the one from the theme.

To provide a configuration file, use the `--config` (or `-c`) option when running `sassdoc`. If the option is not defined, SassDoc will try to find a file named `.sassdocrc` (no extension). So if you don’t feel like passing the `--config` option every time, just name your file `.sassdocrc`.

`    sassdoc source/ -c path/to/config.json # Short option and JSON filesassdoc source/ --config path/to/config.yaml # Long  option and YAML file`

If you are using the Node API rather than the CLI tool, you can pass your configuration object as the second argument of the `sassdoc` function:

`    var sassdoc = require('sassdoc');sassdoc(source, config);`

Options[§](#options)
--------------------

Here are the available configuration options that does not depend on the theme whatsoever:

|   Option  Type  Default   

|   `dest`  String  `./sassdoc`   
|   `exclude`  Array  `[]`   
|   `package`  String / Object  `./package.json`   
|   `theme`  String  `default`   
|   `autofill`  Array  `["requires", "throws", "content"]`   
|   `groups`  Object  `{ undefined: "general" }`   
|   `no-update-notifier`  Boolean  `false`   
|   `verbose`  Boolean  `false`   
|   `strict`  Boolean  `false`   

Destination[§](#destination)
----------------------------

The `dest` option is the path to the documentation directory generated by SassDoc. By default, it is `sassdoc`, in the current directory.

**Caution!** SassDoc will wipe this directory at every run, so do not put anything worthwhile in it.

Exclude[§](#exclude)
--------------------

A list of patterns to exclude from the sources. It’s like passing [negate patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#negation) as `<src>` but in a more persistent fashion.

    exclude:  - private.scss  - ./stylesheets/hidden/*

Package[§](#package)
--------------------

The `package` option is either a path (string) to a JSON file or directly an object. It contains information about the documented project (for instance a `package.json`, hence the name of the key).

If you provide a path, it will be resolved from the configuration file (or CWD if you have no configuration file). By default, it’s `package.json` (with the same resolving rules).

**Note:** a given path must be relative to the configuration file.

If this doesn’t work for you, then you can set your own package. The package object (either direct or required from a path) should ideally contain (for the theme to access to various information about your project):

*   `title`: human name of your project
*   `name`: package name of your project
*   `version`: your project’s version
*   `license`: your project’s license
*   `homepage`: URL to your project’s homepage
*   `description`: description of your project

**Note:** if you set this option as a path, it will be overriden with the content of the mentioned JSON file once in the view, thus `package` will no longer contain a string, but an object.

Theme[§](#theme)
----------------

The `theme` option is the name of a theme to be used. If not set, it will default to `default`, which means SassDoc will use `sassdoc-theme-default`, the official theme.

Based on the value you set, for instance `unicorn`, SassDoc will try to resolve it this way:

*   if the value contains a `/`, it’s `require`d as a Node package;
*   otherwise it’s required as `sassdoc-theme-{{value}}` (like `sassdoc-theme-unicorn` in our example).

**Note:** see [Using Your Own Theme](/using-your-own-theme/) to build your own theme. Also see the [Theme Gallery](/theme-gallery/) to see some existing themes.

Autofill[§](#autofill)
----------------------

The `autofill` option tells which annotations SassDoc should try to autofill when possible. For instance, SassDoc is able to figure from your code if an item requires another item, or if an item is likely to throw an error (`@error` directive from Sass) in some circumstances.

Meanwhile, SassDoc is not a Sass lexer. It is not infallible, and in some rare occasions, it can return some false positive annotations. To prevent this from happening, either you’re able to locate the issue and fix it, or you can disable the autofilling for this specific type of annotation by removing its name from the array.

For instance, a falsy value, like an empty array would disable SassDoc autofill feature altogether:

    autofill: []

Or you can enable only some annotations to be autofilled (here all supported annotations are listed):

    autofill:  - throw  - content  - require

Groups[§](#groups)
------------------

The `groups` option is an object of aliases for group slugs. When you gather items in groups with the `@group` annotation, you specify a slug string, without spaces or formatting (e.g. `api-helpers`). In the `groups` object, you can associate a group slug with a group name so the latter gets used in the view rather than the dirty slug (e.g. `API Helpers`).

All non-grouped items are gathered by SassDoc in an `undefined` group, that is being aliased as _General_ as a default. Feel free to change this to suit your preferences.

    groups:  api-helpers: API Helpers  undefined: Basic API


**Note:** that for this feature to work, [sassdoc-extras](/extra-tools/#groups-aliases) has to be used by the theme, which is obviously the case with the default theme.

No update notifier[§](#no-update-notifier)
------------------------------------------

SassDoc tries to make sure you always use an up-to-date version. If it is not the case, it will prompt you to update your current version. You can disable this behaviour by using the `no-update-notifier` option.

**Note:** you can also use the CLI option `--no-update-notifier`.

Verbose[§](#verbose)
--------------------

SassDoc will output messages at the various documentation process states.



C-style comments[§](#c-style-comments)
--------------------------------------

The support of C-style `/**` comments [has been dropped](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc/issues/326).
You can use the following scripts to upgrade your codebase to `///` comments if you were using them:

**GNU `sed`:**


    find . -name '*.s[ac]ss' -exec sed -i 's,^/\*\*,///,;s,^  *\*\*/,////,;s,^  *\*/,///,;s,^  *\*,///,' {} +


**Mac/BSD `sed`:**


    find . -name '*.s[ac]ss' -exec sed -i '' 's,^/\*\*,///,;s,^  *\*\*/,////,;s,^  *\*/,///,;s,^  *\*,///,' {} +


The script can’t handle all the possible edge cases, so please make sure to run it in a version-controlled environment, and review carefully the changes.

You’ll also have to manually fix all your [poster comments](http://sassdoc.com/file-level-annotations/) by hand since there is no way for this script to convert them accurately; only the closing can be converted, but you’ll need to add a `/` to all poster openings.

If you want to know more on what’s happening in these cryptic `sed` commands, here is the commented `sed` source:
```
# Opening (can't determine if poster or normal)s,^/\*\*,///,
# Poster closings,^  *\*\*/,////,
# Normal closings,^  *\*/,///,
# Comment bodys,^  *\*,///,
```

Annotations[§](#annotations)
----------------------------

The default value of some annotations is now inside square brackets instead of parentheses. This affects `@param` and `@prop`.

**Before:**


`    /// @param {String} $foo (bar) - Baz.@function baz($foo) {}`


**After:**


`    /// @param {String} $foo [bar] - Baz.@function baz($foo) {}`


You can use the following script to update your codebase, though it will replace all the parentheses by square brackets in the lines containing the affected annotations, which may not be what you want (for example if there’s parentheses inside the default value or in the description).

Be sure to review the changes made by the script and eventually fix details by hand.

**GNU `sed`:**


`    find . -type f -name '*.s[ac]ss' -exec sed -ri '/@param|@prop/y/()/[]/' {} +`


**BSD/Mac `sed`:**


    `find . -type f -name '*.s[ac]ss' -exec sed -Ei '' '/@param|@prop/y/\(\)/\[\]/' {} +`





Introduction[§](#introduction)
------------------------------

You can define annotations at a file-level rather than on specific items. It is useful when you have a whole file sharing some annotations (for instance `@group`, `@author` and so on).

Usually, the _poster comment_ goes on top of the file. In order to be parsed as a poster, it has to be prefixed by `////`. You should have 4 slashes on the first and last lines (which are usually empty lines), and any number of slashes in between (3, 4, 5…). See example below. Also, you cannot have more than one poster per file.

Feel free to add a description to it, however it won’t be parsed in any way. For now, it is nothing but a comment. [At some point](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc/issues/256), it might be useful though.

**Warning:** when an item has an annotation that has already been defined on the poster, it **overrides** it. It is not merged with the one from the poster, it purely replaces it.

Example[§](#example)
--------------------


/////// This is a poster comment.
/// It will apply annotations to all items from file.
/// @group API
/// @author Hugo Giraudel

///
//// This item will have:
/// `@group API` and `@author Hugo Giraudel`
/// inherited from the poster.@function dummy-function() {  // ...}

/// This item overrides the `@author` annotation
/// from the poster; it's not merged with it.
/// @author Fabrice Weinberg @mixin dummy-mixin {  // ...}




Introduction[§](#introduction)
------------------------------

Aside from regular [configuration](/configuration/) from SassDoc itself, it is likely that the theme you use provides some kind of default configuration that you can overload.

This is done exactly like the regular configuration, within the same configuration file. Please refer to the [configuration documentation](/configuration/) to learn how to specify a configuration file.

Options[§](#options)
--------------------

[SassDoc’s default theme](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc-theme-default) has a couple of options to give you some extra power over the view.

|   Option  Type  Default   

|   `display.access`  Array  `["public", "private"]`  
|   `display.alias`  Boolean  `false`  
|   `display.watermark`  Boolean  `true`  
|   `basePath`  String  —  
|   `shortcutIcon`  String  —  
|   `googleAnalytics`  String  —  
|   `trackingCode`  String  —  
|   `sort`  Array  —  
|   `description`  String  —  
|   `descriptionPath`  String  —  
|   `privatePrefix`  Regex  `^[_-]`   

Visibility display[§](#visibility-display)
------------------------------------------

The `display.access` option lists access levels that are being displayed, default is all (both `public` and `private`). If you don’t want to display `private` items, you can remove it from the array, like so:

display:  access:    - public

Alias display[§](#alias-display)
--------------------------------

The `display.alias` option defines whether or not aliases should be displayed. Default value is `false`, meaning that aliases items are not displayed in the docs. They are documented and exist in the raw data, but are simply not displayed.

If you want to display aliases as well, change the value to `true`.

    display:  alias: true

Watermark display[§](#watermark-display)
----------------------------------------

The default theme from SassDoc displays a discret _© Made with love by [SassDoc](https://github.com/SassDoc) team._ in the footer, in order to promote the tool and share the love. You can turn off this watermak if you like, but we would really appreciate you to leave it if you use this theme.

    display:  watermark: false  

Along the same lines, if you build your own theme, adding a little mention to SassDoc somewhere on the page would be very nice of you!

Base path[§](#base-path)
------------------------

The `basePath` option is used to provide a _View source_ link to each item in case the code is hosted on a public repository. By setting the option to the base path of your repository, and thanks to SassDoc’s parser keeping track of the file name, the path and the lines number, we are able to build links such as:

    https://github.com/sassdoc/sassdoc-theme-default/tree/master/scss/utils/_functions.scss#L13-L37


**Caution!** as you can see from the previous example, GitHub adds `/tree/master` or `/blob/<branch_name>` between the base path and the file path. To prevent your links from being broken, set your base path to: `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/tree/master` (or `/blob/<branch_name>`).

Shortcut icon[§](#shortcut-icon)
--------------------------------

The `shortcutIcon` option can be used to provide a favicon to your documentation. It accepts a path, either relative or absolute.

    shortcutIcon: assets/images/favicon.png

Google Analytics[§](#google-analytics)
--------------------------------------

If you are using Google Analytics to track users behaviour on your site, you can set your Google Analytics tracking key as a value for the `googleAnalytics` key.

    googleAnalytics: UA-XXXXX-YY

Tracking code[§](#tracking-code)
--------------------------------

In case you don’t use Google Analytics, or use a custom tracking code snippet, you can set it as a value to the `trackingCode` option. It will be directly injected in the DOM as HTML, so be sure to include `<script>` and `</script>` tags if you need them.

    trackingCode: |  <img src="http://piwik.example.org/piwik.php?idsite={$IDSITE}amp;rec=1" style="border:0" alt="" />

**Note:** in YAML, you can leave a single pipe on the first line to indicate that the everything until the next key is a literal string.

**Beware!** This is a possible door to JavaScript code injection. Be careful.

Sort[§](#sort)
--------------

You can customize the order of your items with this option.

Supported criteria are:

*   [`group`](/configuration/#groups)
*   `file`
*   [`line`](/annotations/#comment-range)
*   [`access`](/annotations/#access)

The `sort` context key is an array of strings, representing a sort criteria plus an optional sort order. The sort order is determined if the last character is either `>` or `<` (respectively desc and asc).

    sort:  - access  - line>  - group  - file

This will sort the data by access (public first, then private, `access>` would have inverted the order), then by descending line (last items in the file first), then by alphetical group (case insensitive), then by file.

Description[§](#description)
----------------------------

You can define a complete description of your project (unlike `package.description` which is a short overview). It is parsed as Markdown.

    description: |  This is the description of the project!  * It is parsed as markdown.  * It is displayed in your documentation page.

Description path[§](#description-path)
--------------------------------------

If you prefer to externalize the description in a file, you can use the `descriptionPath` option, which will populate (or overwrite) the `description` option. It is relative to the configuration file, and parsed as Markdown.

    descriptionPath: ../README.md

Example[§](#example)
--------------------

Here’s a JSON example:

    {
      "basePath": "https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc",
      "shortcutIcon": "assets/images/favicon.png",
      "display": {
        "access": ["public", "private"],    
        "alias": false,    
        "watermark": true  
      },  
      "package": "./package.json",
      "theme": "default",
      "groups": {
        "undefined": "General"  
      },  
      "googleAnalytics": "UA-XXXXX-YY",
      "tracking": "<img src=\"http://piwik.example.org/piwik.php?idsite={$IDSITE}amp;rec=1\" style=\"border:0\" alt=\"\" />"
    }

And the same configuration in YAML:

    basePath: https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc
    shortcutIcon: assets/images/favicon.png
    display:
      access: - public  - private    
      alias: false   
      watermark: true
    package: ./package.json
    theme: default
    groups:
      undefined: General
    googleAnalytics: UA-XXXXX-YY
    tracking: |  <img src="http://piwik.example.org/piwik.php?idsite={$IDSITE}amp;rec=1" style="border:0" alt="" />




Private Prefix[§](#private-prefix)
----------------------------------

It is common practice to prefix so called _private_ items by an underscore (`_`) in languages that do not provide a way to have actual private members in order to indicate they are internal tools not meant to be used as part of the public API.

Adding to this, Sass treats hyphens and underscores exactly the same in identifiers, so `_foo` and `-foo` are equivalent when it comes to a functions, mixins and variables name (not for placeholders though, which behave more like CSS classes where `_` and `-` are not the same).

When applied to SassDoc, it means that SassDoc will automatically assume that an item is private (i.e. `@access private`) if it starts with an hyphen or an underscore. You can configure this with the `privatePrefix` option.

When set to `false`, it intimates SassDoc not to assume anything. On the other hand, if a regular expression is given (default is `^[_-]`), SassDoc will assume the item is private if its name matches.

`    privatePrefix: ^[_-]`
    `
---

CLI[§](#cli)
------------

The CLI usage slightly changed, since the destination is now optional and configurable with an option instead of an argument, so you’ll have to update your scripts using SassDoc if you have any.

**Before:**

  sassdoc scss/ doc/

**After:**

  sassdoc scss/ --dest doc/

When you don’t give a destination, SassDoc will put the documentation in a `sassdoc` folder in the current directory.

**SassDoc will wipe the whole destination folder upon each run, so be sure you don’t have anything important in it.**

Node[§](#node)
--------------

The `documentize` function from 1.0 is now the default export from the `sassdoc` module.

**Before:**

  var sassdoc = require('sassdoc');sassdoc.documentize('scss/').then(function () {  console.log('All done!');});

**After:**

  var sassdoc = require('sassdoc');sassdoc('scss/').then(function () {  console.log('All done!');});

The `parse` function still works the same way as in 1.0.
