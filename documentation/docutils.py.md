Docutils: Documentation Utilities
Written in Python, for General- and Special-Purpose Use
Docutils is an open-source text processing system for processing plaintext documentation into useful formats, such as HTML, LaTeX, man-pages, open-document or XML. It includes reStructuredText, the easy to read, easy to use, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup language.


Overview
To get up & running quickly, see the Quick-Start section of the README file.

All documentation can be reached from the Docutils Project Documentation Overview.

To the developers of an open source project, feedback is a great motivator and is very welcome. We also rely on feedback for determining what features to implement. Thus, if you tell us what you need, you may just get it! Please post any feedback to the Docutils-users mailing list.

All discussion about Docutils takes place on the mailing lists.

If you find a bug, please file a bug report or send email to the Docutils-users mailing list. Patch submissions should be filed in the patch tracker (preferred) or sent to Docutils-develop (where you will be asked to send them to the patch tracker).

We welcome all kinds of contributions. There's a To Do list full of interesting ideas awaiting a champion. If you have any questions regarding how to extend Docutils, please feel free to ask on the Docutils-develop mailing list.

The only requirement for running Docutils is Python

After Docutil 0.14 Python 2.4 and Python 2.5 support will be dropped.
Docutils 0.10 dropped Python 2.3 support.
For Docutils 0.5, Python 2.2.1+ is required.
Up to Docutils 0.4, Python 2.1 is required.
From version 0.6, Docutils is compatible with Python 3 (see README for details).
Docutils is in active development and APIs should be considered experimental subject to change at any time. Although any time is a time after serious thought and discussion.
