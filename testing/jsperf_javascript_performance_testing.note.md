jsPerf — JavaScript performance playground
What is jsPerf?
jsPerf aims to provide an easy way to create and share test cases, comparing the performance of different JavaScript snippets by running benchmarks. For more information, see the FAQ.

 Which benchmarking engine is being used?
 jsPerf is proudly powered by Benchmark.js, a robust JavaScript benchmarking library that works on nearly all JavaScript platforms, supports high-resolution timers, and returns statistically significant results. Kudos to John-David Dalton for his awesome work on this project!
