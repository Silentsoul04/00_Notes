This project is feature complete.

Make sure to set the files to never expire for this to have an effect.

Install


$ npm install --save-dev gulp-rev
Usage


const gulp = require('gulp');
const rev = require('gulp-rev');
 
gulp.task('default', () =>
    gulp.src('src/*.css')
        .pipe(rev())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
);
API

rev()
rev.manifest([path], [options])
path
Type: string
Default: rev-manifest.json

Manifest file path.

options
base
Type: string
Default: process.cwd()

Override the base of the manifest file.

cwd
Type: string
Default: process.cwd()

Override the current working directory of the manifest file.

merge
Type: boolean
Default: false

Merge existing manifest file.

transformer
Type: object
Default: JSON

An object with parse and stringify methods. This can be used to provide a custom transformer instead of the default JSON for the manifest file.

Original path
Original file paths are stored at file.revOrigPath. This could come in handy for things like rewriting references to the assets.

Asset hash
The hash of each rev'd file is stored at file.revHash. You can use this for customizing the file renaming, or for building different manifest formats.

Asset manifest

const gulp = require('gulp');
const rev = require('gulp-rev');
 
gulp.task('default', () =>
    // by default, gulp would pick `assets/css` as the base, 
    // so we need to set it explicitly: 
    gulp.src(['assets/css/*.css', 'assets/js/*.js'], {base: 'assets'})
        .pipe(gulp.dest('build/assets'))  // copy original assets to build dir 
        .pipe(rev())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('build/assets'))  // write rev'd assets to build dir 
        .pipe(rev.manifest())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('build/assets'))  // write manifest to build dir 
);
An asset manifest, mapping the original paths to the revisioned paths, will be written to build/assets/rev-manifest.json:


{
    "css/unicorn.css": "css/unicorn-d41d8cd98f.css",
    "js/unicorn.js": "js/unicorn-273c2c123f.js"
}
By default, rev-manifest.json will be replaced as a whole. To merge with an existing manifest, pass merge: true and the output destination (as base) to rev.manifest():


const gulp = require('gulp');
const rev = require('gulp-rev');
 
gulp.task('default', () =>
    // by default, gulp would pick `assets/css` as the base, 
    // so we need to set it explicitly: 
    gulp.src(['assets/css/*.css', 'assets/js/*.js'], {base: 'assets'})
        .pipe(gulp.dest('build/assets'))
        .pipe(rev())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('build/assets'))
        .pipe(rev.manifest({
            base: 'build/assets',
            merge: true // merge with the existing manifest if one exists 
        }))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('build/assets'))
);
You can optionally call rev.manifest('manifest.json') to give it a different path or filename.

Sourcemaps and gulp-concat

Because of the way gulp-concat handles file paths, you may need to set cwd and path manually on your gulp-concat instance to get everything to work correctly:


const gulp = require('gulp');
const rev = require('gulp-rev');
const sourcemaps = require('gulp-sourcemaps');
const concat = require('gulp-concat');
 
gulp.task('default', () =>
    gulp.src('src/*.js')
        .pipe(sourcemaps.init())
        .pipe(concat({path: 'bundle.js', cwd: ''}))
        .pipe(rev())
        .pipe(sourcemaps.write('.'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
)
Different hash for unchanged files

Since the order of streams are not guaranteed, some plugins such as gulp-concat can cause the final file's content and hash to change. To avoid generating a new hash for unchanged source files, you can:

Sort the streams with gulp-sort
Filter unchanged files with gulp-unchanged

Streaming

This plugin does not support streaming. If you have files from a streaming source, such as Browserify, you should use gulp-buffer before gulp-rev in your pipeline:


const gulp = require('gulp');
const browserify = require('browserify');
const source = require('vinyl-source-stream');
const buffer = require('gulp-buffer');
const rev = require('gulp-rev');
 
gulp.task('default', () =>
    browserify('src/index.js')
        .bundle({debug: true})
        .pipe(source('index.min.js'))
        .pipe(buffer())
        .pipe(rev())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
);
Integration

Works with gulp-rev

gulp-rev-replace - Rewrite occurences of filenames which have been renamed
gulp-rev-css-url - Override URLs in CSS files with the revved ones
gulp-rev-outdated - Old static asset revision files filter
gulp-rev-collector - Static asset revision data collector
rev-del - Delete old unused assets
gulp-rev-delete-original - Delete original files after rev
gulp-rev-loader - Use rev-manifest with webpack
gulp-rev-format - Provide hash formatting options for static assets (prefix, suffix, last-extension)
