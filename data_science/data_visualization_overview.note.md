# Data Presentation and Visualization




## References





## Languages and Syntax  

These are high level formats that can be used to describe data

An ideal choice will implement plain text descriptions and support all features required to accurately reproduce a data relationship

These descriptions are used as inputs into graphics and rendering libraries

- Local Installed Software

High availability of choices and integrations
Lowest effort to bootstrap a project and start working
Poor choice for long term use as licensing and pricing may not be consistent over time
Does not scale with growth of the company
One program may not meet all needs for every project requiring multiple applications
May not be supported on all platforms requiring interoperability across software
Requires every user to have a copy of the program and files
Can lead to bottlenecks and can lead to delays and disruptions if there is not access to a particular machine or file

### Binary Files (JPEG, PNG, TIFF)

Binary file formats have the highest compatibility across platforms and visual consistency when embedded into other programs

Once rendered it is no longer possible to modify or extract information back out of the file so they should never be kept as the only existing copy of piece of work

This format also has the highest cost for data storage and due to compression and secondary modifications the overall quality of the visual image may degrade over time

__When to use__

1. Binary formats may be preferred for embedding images into web or presentations to ensure they will show correctly across systems

2. Binary files should not be stored as the only copy of piece of work since its is no longer possible to extract information to later use

3. When sending files to 3rd parties you should prefer sending a binary file format to prevent secondary use and loss of intellectual property.
