Everything is usually working fine until you have to chagne a port, then it seems like you can never get back to where you came from. 


redis['port'] = 6379
redis['master_port'] = 6379
Redis TCP host = "127.0.0.1"
Redis TCP port = 6379
Redis SOCK "/var/opt/gitlab/redis/redis.socket"


Unicorn listen'] = '127.0.0.1'
# unicorn['port'] = 8484
# unicorn['socket'] = '/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/sockets/gitlab.socket'
