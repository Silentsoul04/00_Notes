Most people do know that Ctrl+Z will suspend and background a running task, and that it can be brought back to focus using the fg (foreground) command (or that a list of suspended tasks can be seen by running jobs). But there are a lot more key-strokes that most people are unaware of.

Bash actually uses a lot of Emacs key bindings. You could set it to Vim mode, but that might get little weird at times. I prefer to keep it in the default Emacs mode to keep things simple. Here are a few important keyboard shortcuts to remember:

Ctrl+A – jump to the beginning of the line
Ctrl+E – jump to the end of the line
Ctrl+U – clear the line
Ctrl+L – clear the screen
Ctrl+W – delete last word
Ctrl+K – delete to the end of the line
Alt+T – swap current word with previous (also Esc, T)
Alt+F – jump one word forward (also Esc, F)
Alt+B – jump one word backward (also Esc, B)
Alt+U – uppercase till the end of line (also Esc, U)
Alt+u – lowercase till the end of line (also Esc, u)
Alt+. – insert last arbument (also Esc, .)
Ctrl+R – reverse incremental history search
Ctrl+X, Ctrl+E – open default text editor to edit a command
